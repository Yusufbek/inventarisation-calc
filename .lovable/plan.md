## Host Image for Public URL

### What Will Be Done

Copy your uploaded image to the `public/images/` folder so it becomes accessible via a public URL.

### Technical Details

**Action**: Copy `user-uploads://13_2.png` to `public/images/13_2.png`

### Result

After publishing, your image will be available at:

**URL**: `https://inventarisation-calc.lovable.app/images/13_2.png`

You can use this URL anywhere you need - in ads, social media, external platforms, etc.

### Note

The image won't be displayed on any page of your website - it will just be hosted and accessible via the direct URL above.
